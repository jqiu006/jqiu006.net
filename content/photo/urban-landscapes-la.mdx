### Themes Explored

**Architectural Evolution**
The series documents LA's architectural timeline, from Art Deco buildings of the 1920s to contemporary glass towers, showing how the city has evolved while maintaining its unique character.

**Urban Diversity**
Each neighborhood tells a different story through its built environment - from the industrial heritage of the Arts District to the beachside modernism of Santa Monica.

**Light and Shadow**
California's distinctive light quality creates dramatic contrasts throughout the day, with harsh midday shadows giving way to warm golden hour illumination.
