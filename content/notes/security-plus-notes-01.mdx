# Network Security Fundamentals

These are my study notes for the CompTIA Security+ certification, focusing on network security fundamentals and best practices.

## Network Security Devices

### Firewalls

Firewalls are the first line of defense in network security, controlling traffic flow based on predetermined security rules.

**Types of Firewalls:**
- **Packet Filtering**: Examines packets at network layer
- **Stateful Inspection**: Tracks connection state
- **Application Layer**: Deep packet inspection at application layer
- **Next-Generation (NGFW)**: Combines traditional firewall with additional features

```bash
# Example iptables rule
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -s 192.168.1.0/24 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j DROP
```

### Network Segmentation

Dividing networks into smaller, isolated segments to limit attack surface and contain breaches.

**Implementation Methods:**
- VLANs (Virtual LANs)
- Subnetting
- DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)
- Air-gapped networks

## VPN Technologies

### IPSec
- **AH (Authentication Header)**: Provides authentication and integrity
- **ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload)**: Provides confidentiality, authentication, and integrity
- **Tunnel Mode**: Entire IP packet is encrypted
- **Transport Mode**: Only payload is encrypted

### SSL/TLS VPN
- Operates at application layer
- Browser-based access
- Easier to deploy and manage
- Good for remote access scenarios

## Network Attacks and Mitigation

### Common Attack Vectors
1. **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)**
   - Mitigation: Use encryption, certificate pinning
2. **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)**
   - Mitigation: Rate limiting, traffic filtering, CDN
3. **ARP Spoofing**
   - Mitigation: Static ARP entries, DAI (Dynamic ARP Inspection)

### Network Monitoring
- **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)**
- **IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems)**
- **Network Traffic Analysis**
- **Log Correlation**

## Key Takeaways

- Defense in depth is crucial - multiple layers of security
- Network segmentation limits blast radius of attacks
- Proper monitoring and logging enable quick incident response
- Regular security assessments help identify vulnerabilities
