# Enterprise VLAN Network Segmentation & Security

## Background & Security Requirements

As my homelab grew to include IoT devices, guest access, and critical infrastructure services, the flat network topology became a security liability. I needed to implement proper network segmentation to:

- **Isolate Critical Infrastructure**: Separate management and production networks
- **Contain Security Breaches**: Limit lateral movement in case of compromise
- **Implement Zero Trust**: Default-deny policies with explicit allow rules
- **Manage Guest Access**: Provide internet access without local network exposure
- **Organize Device Categories**: Group similar devices for easier management
- **Enable Monitoring**: Centralized logging and traffic analysis per network segment

The challenge was to design a scalable VLAN architecture that balanced security with operational efficiency.

## Network Architecture & Design

### VLAN Segmentation Strategy

The network is segmented into logical zones based on trust levels and functional requirements:

| VLAN ID | Network Name | Subnet | Purpose | Trust Level |
|---------|--------------|---------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | Management | 192.168.1.0/24 | Network infrastructure, admin access | High |
| 10 | Infrastructure | 192.168.10.0/24 | Servers, hypervisors, storage | High |
| 20 | Guest Network | 192.168.20.0/24 | Visitor devices, temporary access | Low |
| 30 | IoT Devices | 192.168.30.0/24 | Smart home, sensors, cameras | Medium |
| 40 | Backup Services | 192.168.40.0/24 | Backup systems, replication | High |
| 50 | Printer Network | 192.168.50.0/24 | Network printers, scanners | Medium |

## Implementation Details

### OPNsense VLAN Configuration

**Step-by-Step VLAN Setup Process**:

1. **Create VLAN Interface**:
   ```
   Interfaces → Other Types → VLAN
   - Parent Interface: LAN (re0)
   - VLAN Tag: 10
   - Description: Infrastructure
   ```

2. **Assign VLAN to Interface**:
   ```
   Interfaces → Assignments
   - Add new interface for VLAN 10
   - Enable interface
   - Configure as OPT1
   ```

3. **Configure Static IP**:
   ```
   Interfaces → OPT1
   - IPv4 Configuration: Static
   - IPv4 Address: 192.168.10.1/24
   - Description: Infrastructure VLAN
   ```

4. **Enable DHCP Service**:
   ```
   Services → DHCPv4 → OPT1
   - Enable DHCP server
   - Range: 192.168.10.100 - 192.168.10.200
   - Gateway: 192.168.10.1
   - DNS Servers: 192.168.10.1, 1.1.1.1
   ```

### Firewall Rules & Security Policies

**Default Security Posture**:
- All VLANs start with implicit deny-all rules
- Explicit allow rules for required communication
- Logging enabled for denied traffic analysis

**Inter-VLAN Communication Matrix**:

| Source VLAN | Destination | Access Policy |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| Management (1) | All VLANs | Full access (administrative) |
| Infrastructure (10) | Internet, DNS | Allow outbound only |
| Guest (20) | Internet only | Block all local networks |
| IoT (30) | Internet, NTP | Limited local access |
| Backup (40) | Infrastructure | Backup protocols only |
| Printer (50) | Management, Infrastructure | Print services only |

**Example Firewall Rules (Guest VLAN)**:
```
# Allow internet access
Pass - IPv4 - Source: VLAN20 net - Destination: !RFC1918 - Any protocol

# Block local networks
Block - IPv4 - Source: VLAN20 net - Destination: RFC1918 - Any protocol

# Allow DNS to gateway
Pass - IPv4 - Source: VLAN20 net - Destination: 192.168.20.1 - Port: 53
```

### Device Configuration Examples

**Raspberry Pi VLAN Configuration (systemd-networkd)**:

**Main Interface Configuration** (`/etc/systemd/network/10-eth0.network`):
```ini
[Match]
Name=eth0

[Network]
DHCP=no
VLAN=eth0.10
```

**VLAN Interface Definition** (`/etc/systemd/network/20-eth0.10.netdev`):
```ini
[NetDev]
Name=eth0.10
Kind=vlan

[VLAN]
Id=10
```

**VLAN Network Configuration** (`/etc/systemd/network/20-eth0.10.network`):
```ini
[Match]
Name=eth0.10

[Network]
DHCP=ipv4
```

**Apply Configuration**:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart systemd-networkd
sudo systemctl status systemd-networkd
```

### Switch Configuration

**VLAN Port Assignment Strategy**:

| Port | Configuration | VLANs | Purpose |
|------|---------------|-------|---------|
| 1-4 | Access | VLAN 1 | Management devices |
| 5-8 | Access | VLAN 10 | Infrastructure servers |
| 9-12 | Access | VLAN 30 | IoT devices |
| 13-16 | Access | VLAN 20 | Guest access points |
| 24 | Trunk | All VLANs | Uplink to OPNsense |

**Trunk Port Configuration**:
- Tagged: VLANs 1, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50
- Native VLAN: 1 (Management)
- Frame size: 9000 bytes (Jumbo frames)

## Advanced Features & Solutions

### Dynamic DHCP Reservations

**Static IP Assignment by MAC Address**:
```
Services → DHCPv4 → [VLAN] → Static Mappings
- MAC Address: aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff
- IP Address: 192.168.10.5
- Hostname: server01
- Description: Primary application server
```

**Benefits**:
- Predictable IP addressing for servers
- Simplified firewall rule management
- Easier monitoring and troubleshooting

### DNS Resolution Across VLANs

**Pi-hole Integration**:
- Deployed Pi-hole in Infrastructure VLAN (192.168.10.5)
- Configured as primary DNS for all VLANs
- Local DNS entries for internal services
- Ad-blocking and malware protection

**DNS Configuration per VLAN**:
```
DHCP Options:
- Primary DNS: 192.168.10.5 (Pi-hole)
- Secondary DNS: 1.1.1.1 (Cloudflare)
- Domain: homelab.local
```

### Network Monitoring & Logging

**Traffic Analysis**:
- Firewall logs centralized in OPNsense
- Per-VLAN bandwidth monitoring
- Intrusion detection alerts
- Automated log rotation and archival

**Monitoring Dashboard**:
```
System → Logging → Firewall
- Real-time traffic analysis
- Top talkers by VLAN
- Blocked connection attempts
- Bandwidth utilization graphs
```

## Troubleshooting & Lessons Learned

### Common Configuration Issues

**Problem**: Devices unable to obtain DHCP leases
**Root Cause**: Switch port not properly configured for VLAN tagging
**Solution**: Verify switch port configuration matches device VLAN requirements
```bash
# Verify VLAN interface is up
ip link show eth0.10

# Check DHCP client status
systemctl status systemd-networkd
journalctl -u systemd-networkd
```

**Problem**: Inter-VLAN communication blocked unexpectedly
**Root Cause**: Firewall rules applied in wrong order
**Solution**: Review rule precedence and ensure specific rules come before general ones

**Problem**: Windows WSL unable to access network when VLAN tagged
**Root Cause**: WSL cannot process VLAN-tagged packets during network translation
**Solution**: Configure switch port as untagged for Windows hosts
```
Switch Configuration:
- Port Mode: Access (untagged)
- VLAN ID: 10
- Native VLAN: 10
```

### Performance Optimization

**VLAN Interface Tuning**:
```bash
# Increase MTU for infrastructure VLAN
sudo ip link set dev eth0.10 mtu 9000

# Enable hardware VLAN acceleration
ethtool -K eth0 rx-vlan-offload on tx-vlan-offload on
```

**Switch Optimization**:
- Enable flow control for high-bandwidth VLANs
- Configure QoS priorities for critical traffic
- Implement storm control for broadcast traffic

### Security Hardening

**Additional Security Measures**:

1. **MAC Address Filtering**: Whitelist known devices per VLAN
2. **Port Security**: Limit number of MAC addresses per switch port
3. **DHCP Snooping**: Prevent rogue DHCP servers
4. **Dynamic ARP Inspection**: Validate ARP packets against DHCP bindings

**Firewall Rule Optimization**:
```
# Log and block invalid traffic
Block - IPv4 - Source: Any - Destination: Any - Invalid state
Log: Enabled

# Rate limiting for ICMP
Pass - ICMP - Source: Any - Destination: Any
Advanced: Limit 10/second
```
