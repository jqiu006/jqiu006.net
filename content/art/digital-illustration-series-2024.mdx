# Digital Illustration Series 2024

This series explores the intersection of technology and humanity through a cyberpunk lens. Each piece was created using a combination of digital painting techniques and 3D rendering.

## Creative Process

The illustrations began as rough sketches, exploring composition and lighting. I used Photoshop for the main painting work, with additional 3D elements created in Blender for complex architectural structures.

### Tools Used
- **Adobe Photoshop** - Primary painting and compositing
- **Blender** - 3D modeling and rendering
- **Wacom Cintiq Pro 24** - Digital drawing tablet
- **Custom brushes** - For texture and atmospheric effects

## Artistic Vision

The cyberpunk genre allows for exploration of themes like:
- Technology's impact on society
- The blending of organic and synthetic
- Urban decay and renewal
- The beauty found in industrial landscapes

Each piece in this series tells a story about characters navigating a world where technology has fundamentally changed human experience.

## Technical Approach

### Lighting Design
- **Neon lighting** creates mood and atmosphere
- **Volumetric fog** adds depth and mystery
- **Color temperature contrast** between warm and cool tones
- **Rim lighting** separates subjects from backgrounds

### Color Palette
The series uses a consistent palette of:
- Electric blues and cyans
- Warm oranges and magentas
- Deep purples and blacks
- Bright accent colors for focal points

## Future Directions

This series will continue to evolve, with plans to explore:
- Interactive digital installations
- Animation and motion graphics
- Virtual reality experiences
- Collaboration with musicians for audiovisual pieces

The goal is to create immersive worlds that viewers can lose themselves in, while reflecting on our relationship with technology.
